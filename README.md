# Jotter

Jotter is a note taking app that does not disrupt your flow. It overlays on top of other apps instead of being a standalone app that you have to switch to.
Our main tenets are speed, accessibility, and privacy.

## Key features

- Jotter lives in your system tray and acts like an overlay on top of all your other apps.
- Jotter is a markdown editor that saves notes locally as markdown files.
- Full text search on all of your notes.
- A focus on both keyboard shortcuts and GUI to make Jotter best fit its tenets.
