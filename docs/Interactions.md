# Interactions

The Jotter app has three modes, closed, write, and edit. In the closed mode, Jotter just sits in the system tray doing nothing. In the write mode, the write overlay pops up allowing users to access a little note taking overlay on their screen. On edit mode, users can search and edit past notes.

## Write mode

The primary purpose of write mode is to give users access to a little notepad that they can use whatever they are doing.

### Access

- From tray system icon
- WRITE_ENTRY global shortcut (shift + cmd + n)
- WRITE_NOTE local shortcut while in Edit mode (shift + cmd + E)
